    - Overall performance summary
    - Specific strengths with examples
    - Areas needing improvement with specific suggestions
    - Learning style observations
    - Motivational and encouraging language
    - Practical study recommendations
    - Goal-setting suggestions

    **Question Type Analysis:**
    - MCQ: Analyze accuracy and decision-making patterns
    - MSQ: Evaluate comprehensive understanding and attention to detail
    - NAT: Assess numerical and analytical skills
    - Subjective: Evaluate critical thinking, communication, and depth of understanding

    **Report Quality Standards:**
    - Be constructive and encouraging while being honest about areas needing improvement
    - Provide specific, actionable recommendations
