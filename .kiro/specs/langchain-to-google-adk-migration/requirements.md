# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature involves migrating all independent agents in the LumenSlate AI microservice from LangChain to Google Agent Development Kit (ADK). The current system has 7 independent agents that use LangChain's ChatGoogleGenerativeAI and related components for AI interactions. This migration will modernize the agent architecture, improve performance, and align with Google's latest AI development tools while maintaining all existing functionality.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer maintaining the LumenSlate AI microservice, I want all independent agents migrated from LangChain to Google Agent Development Kit, so that the system uses modern Google AI tools and has improved performance and maintainability.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the migration is complete THEN all 7 independent agents SHALL use Google Agent Development Kit instead of LangChain
2. WHEN an agent is called THEN it SHALL produce the same output format and functionality as the original LangChain implementation
3. WHEN the system starts THEN all migrated agents SHALL initialize successfully without LangChain dependencies
4. WHEN any agent function is invoked THEN it SHALL maintain the same input/output interface as before migration

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the migrated agents to maintain backward compatibility, so that existing gRPC endpoints and service integrations continue to work without modification.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN existing gRPC services call agent functions THEN they SHALL receive responses in the same format as before
2. WHEN Pydantic models are used for input/output THEN they SHALL remain unchanged after migration
3. WHEN structured output is required THEN the Google ADK implementation SHALL provide equivalent structured response capabilities
4. WHEN error conditions occur THEN the error handling SHALL maintain the same behavior as the LangChain implementation

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the migration to include proper dependency management, so that LangChain dependencies can be safely removed and Google ADK dependencies are properly configured.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the migration is complete THEN requirements.txt SHALL be updated to remove LangChain dependencies
2. WHEN the migration is complete THEN requirements.txt SHALL include necessary Google Agent Development Kit dependencies
3. WHEN the system is deployed THEN it SHALL not have any unused LangChain imports or references
4. WHEN environment configuration is checked THEN Google ADK SHALL use the existing GOOGLE_API_KEY and related environment variables

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a quality assurance engineer, I want comprehensive testing of migrated agents, so that I can verify functionality is preserved and performance is maintained or improved.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN each agent is migrated THEN unit tests SHALL be created or updated to verify functionality
2. WHEN integration tests are run THEN all migrated agents SHALL pass existing test suites
3. WHEN performance is measured THEN migrated agents SHALL perform at least as well as LangChain implementations
4. WHEN structured output validation is tested THEN Google ADK agents SHALL produce valid Pydantic model responses

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want clear documentation and code organization for the migrated agents, so that the codebase remains maintainable and follows established patterns.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN agents are migrated THEN they SHALL maintain the same directory structure and file organization
2. WHEN code is reviewed THEN migrated agents SHALL follow the same naming conventions and patterns as existing code
3. WHEN prompt templates are used THEN they SHALL remain in separate files and be imported consistently
4. WHEN configuration is needed THEN it SHALL use the existing app/config pattern and environment variable management

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a system integrator, I want the migration to handle all agent types consistently, so that the different agent functionalities (context generation, variable detection, MCQ/MSQ variation, etc.) all work seamlessly with Google ADK.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN context_generator is migrated THEN it SHALL generate educational context using Google ADK with the same prompt template
2. WHEN variable_detector is migrated THEN it SHALL detect and return variables with structured output using Google ADK
3. WHEN mcq_variation_generator is migrated THEN it SHALL generate MCQ variations with proper structured responses
4. WHEN msq_variation_generator is migrated THEN it SHALL generate MSQ variations maintaining the same output format
5. WHEN question_segment_generator is migrated THEN it SHALL segment questions using Google ADK
6. WHEN variable_randomizer is migrated THEN it SHALL randomize variables with the same functionality
7. WHEN assignment_generator_general is migrated THEN it SHALL generate assignments using Google ADK with equivalent capabilities

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a DevOps engineer, I want the migration to be deployable without service interruption, so that the production system can be updated seamlessly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the migration is deployed THEN the gRPC server SHALL start successfully with all migrated agents
2. WHEN health checks are performed THEN all agent endpoints SHALL respond correctly
3. WHEN the Docker container is built THEN it SHALL include only necessary dependencies without LangChain
4. WHEN the service is deployed to Google Cloud Run THEN it SHALL function correctly with the new Google ADK implementation
